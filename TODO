all:
	- when API is stable, move to gopkg.in/macaroon.v1

macaroon:

	- Implement encoding.BinaryMarshaler
	and encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler on Macaroon.
	These should be compatible with libmacaroons.

	- change all signature calculations to correspond exactly
	with libmacaroons.

	- change AddThirdPartyCaveat to accept a simple string
	id, leaving it up to external packages to decide how to
	encode the id. Delete DecryptThirdPartyCaveatId and
	ThirdPartyCaveatId.

	- add:

		type Caveat struct {
			Condition string
			Location string
		}

		and provide an access method to access caveats
		in this form.

		[possibly change AddThirdPartyCaveat to use it]

		We don't need to export the existing
		internal caveat type.

	- change the result of the check function
	passed to Verify to func(string) error.
	(consider adding some kind of "temporary error"
	classification to indicate when a caveat might possibly
	be discharged by trying the verification again.)
